# Modular JavaScript

This is a basic example of writing modular JavaScript.

In the example file, we are only loading one script, and loading modules based on feature detection.

The "a" span was detected by jquery, so that module is loaded.

There was no tag with "b", so that module was not loaded.

Entire modules and/or libraries could be loaded based on feature detection, or other criteria (routing, media queries, etc)
